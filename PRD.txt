Create a app with the following requirements:
1. Run on Mac OS
2. When it runs, it’s running in the background.
3. It listens to a shortcut key to Shift+Command+P to trigger an action. The shortcut key should works globally, no matter where I am. 
4. When the shortcut key is pressed, it will prompt a system notification that says “hello world”.
5. The app should not require me to give Accessibility permissions to Terminal

Make sure the app is fully tested, and could run perfectly. 
Provide me with comprehensive instruction to run the app.
